- 🌱 I’m currently learning different programming languages (c#, python, c++), video game engines (unreal, unity) and some 3d sculpting
- 🤔 Would like to learn more about machine learning, provide to open source and some full stack development
- 😄 Pronouns: She/They
- ⚡ Fun fact: I also happen to be an avid gamer
- ⭐ Future goals: Work in the industry as programmer and keep learning new things and continue creating
